### Pre-Installation

	MAKE SURE TO HAVE REDMOD INSTALLED,IF YOU ARE ON STEAM. YOU CAN DO SO BY GOING ON THE DLC PAGE FOR CYBERPUNK 2077 AND CAN DOWNLOAD IT FROM THERE. ITS THE SAME FOR OTHER CLIENTS AS WELL.

1. **Clean Install**: Start with a fresh installation of Cyberpunk 2077, especially if you’ve previously installed mods. This reduces the risk of conflicts or leftover files affecting your modlist

2. To do this head to your "appdata" folder by searching in the windows searchbar and typing %appdata%
