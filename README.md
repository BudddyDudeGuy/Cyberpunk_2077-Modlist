## INTRODUCTION


Welcome to the Cyberpunk 2077 Enhanced Modlist! The modlist is literally the title, Cyberpunk 2077 but better! Better driving handling, guns, enemies, quests, economy and way more! We meticulously adjusted many in game files and curated mods from amazing authors to improve gameplay loops, fix bugs and add quality of life features. We have repeatedly tested the game over hudnreds of hours of gameplay, making sure the list is stable, performance friendly and balanced in terms of gameplay. My vision for this modlist was to not add mods that abstructed the vanilla vision of Cyberpunk 2077's gameplay and lore. I aimed to make it as Immersive and lore friendly as possible. We tried to the best of our ability, along with the help of testers and mod authors to make this list as bug free as possible with CHALLENIGING but balanced combat.

Beyond gameplay, this modlist also brings substantial improvements to visuals and performance, through carefully selected graphic and optimization mods. Ray tracing and path tracing are heavily optimmized, paired along with amazing LUTS from mod authors the game looks amazing while increasing perfomrance at the same time!

### PRE-INSTALLATION

	MAKE SURE TO HAVE REDMOD INSTALLED,IF YOU ARE ON STEAM. YOU CAN DO SO BY GOING ON THE DLC PAGE FOR CYBERPUNK 2077 AND CAN DOWNLOAD IT FROM THERE. ITS THE SAME FOR OTHER CLIENTS AS WELL.

1. **Clean Install**: Start with a fresh installation of Cyberpunk 2077, especially if you’ve previously installed mods. This reduces the risk of conflicts or leftover files affecting your modlist
